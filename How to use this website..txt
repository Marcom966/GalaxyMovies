Please, open opening.html first and then seach for a movie title, you'll find a more in
depth guide inside the website itself. 
DISCLAMER. due to some bugs i suggest you to open directly the index.html page as the seach result will
display the second time you research for a film title. I'm working at correcting this bug at the moment.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
